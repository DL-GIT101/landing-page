Project: Landing Page - TOP bootcamp


This is my take on the Project: Landing Page of TOP foundation Course

Feel free to comment about the code or some encouragement

    - I do have a background with html and css but the lessons freshens my memory and added new knowledge as well as 
    - tips and tricks on how to code more efficiently
    - The flexbox is a new thing to me and really made my brain go brrr to this new codes and yet I enjoyed it as I
    - think of better ways to design my other past projects which I will tackle in the near future for my portfolio
